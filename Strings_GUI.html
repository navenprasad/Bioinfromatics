<H2>4.4 The StringTest project</H2>
<P>Get the project stringtest from the subject web site. 
</P>
<P>It has in it two classes: 
</P>
<P>StringTester: 
</P>
<UL>
	<P>This is the main class that has a user interface. Create an
	object of this class to start the application. It will show a
	graphical user interface that offers some string operations. This
	class is complete you do not have to change it.</P>
</UL>
<P>StringEngine: 
</P>
<UL>
	<P>This is the class that implements the string operation
	functionality. This class is not properly implemented. It is your
	job to implement the operations in this class.</P>
</UL>
<P>The interface of the application shows a row of buttons at the
top, a string in the middle (the &quot;display&quot;), and a text
field and some buttons at the bottom. The display initially says
&quot;Welcome to the String Tester&quot;. 
</P>
<UL>
	<P>The buttons are intended to do the following:</P>
</UL>
<P><B>UPPERCASE:</B> Switches the display to upper case. 
</P>
<P><B>lowercase:</B> Switches the display to lower case. 
</P>
<P><B>Titlecase:</B> Switches the display to title case. Initially,
just try to turn the first letter of the display to upper case, and
the rest to lower case. As a real challenge task (after you finish
everything else), try to start each word with an upper case letter. 
</P>
<P><B>Strip:</B> Remove all spaces at the beginning and the end of
the display. 
</P>
<P><B>Length:</B> Display the length (number of characters) of the
display. 
</P>
<P><B>Quit:</B> Quit the application. 
</P>
<P><B>Append:</B> Add the text from the text filed to the end of the
display. 
</P>
<P><B>Prepend:</B> Add the text from the text filed to the start of
the display string. 
</P>
<P><B>Insert:</B> Insert the string in the text field into the middle
of the displayed string. 
</P>
<P><B>Replace:</B> Replace the display with the string in the text
field. 
</P>
<P>The interface for this application is already implemented. You
only need to implement the StringEngine class. Most of the method
signatures are already written, 
</P>
<P><I>Hint:</I></P>
<P>To implement the StringEngine methods, you need to get access to
the display string and the string from the text field (the &quot;input
string&quot;). You can get them from the StringTester class: The
string tester has two methods: 
</P>
<UL>
	<P>public String getDisplayString() 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>and 
</P>
<UL>
	<P>public String getInputString() 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>that return those strings. To get access to these methods, you
need a reference to the StringTester object in the StringEngine
object. To achieve this, do the following: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>define an instance field named &quot;userInterface&quot; in
	the StringEngine class; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>add a parameter &quot;interfaceObject&quot; to the
	constructor of StringEngine; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>in the constructor, assign &quot;interfaceObject&quot; to
	&quot;userInterface&quot;; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>in the StringTester class, where the StringEngine object is
	created (and the constructor called) you need to add the parameter.
	Pass in &quot;this&quot; as the parameter that will pass the
	StringTester object itself; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>in the StringEngine methods implementing the operations, you
	can now write lines such as <BR>String display =
	userInterface.getDisplayString();<BR>String input =
	userInterface.getInputString();</P>
</UL>
<P><EM>Finally</EM>, add a <STRONG>JTextField outputText;</STRONG> to
the StringTester GUI, just under the JLabel. Re-write the output
method so that output is displayed in both the JLabel and the
JTextField.</P>
<P><I><B>Another important hint:</B></I></P>
<P>Don't work alone! Work in pairs or small groups, walk around, look
at other peoples ideas, discuss! 
</P>
<H2>5.3 GUI for StringTester</H2>
<P>Copy the StringTester code from the previous week's directory into
this week's. Look at StringTester.java - note that each button has a
separate ActionListener, which is in a separate class. Re-write
StringTester.java so that the StringTester class handles all of the
button events itself. That is, it must become an ActionListener by
implementing the ActionListener interface. Each time you create a
button, add 'this' as its ActionListener. Then StringTester.java must
have an 'actionPerformed(ActionEvent event)' method to handle all of
the button events.<BR>If you want, finally add a JLabel with your
favorite (small) image to the StringTester GUI.</P>
<H2>5.4 Make a Java project</H2>
<P>After re-writing the StringTester source code, combine
StringTester.java and StringEngine.java into a Java project. To do
this, put both files into a subdirectory of the current one, named,
e.g., mySTT. In each file insert the line 'package mySTT;' at the
very top of the file. Remember, the package declaration must be the
first statement in the file. I find that both BlueJ and JCreator
handle packages in ways that are difficult to understand. So, from
the command line, in the directory ABOVE mySTT, to compile them
type<BR>'javac mySTT/StringTester.java' .<BR>To run them type, again
in the parent directory,<BR>'java mySTT.StringTester'<BR>(Note that
since they were created in BlueJ, they may not have a 'main(String[]
args)' method, in which case you will have to write one in the
StringTester.java file.</P>
